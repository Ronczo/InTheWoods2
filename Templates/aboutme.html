      <p> I am a self-educated developer</p>
      <p> I have master's degree in economics and I am an experienced employee in sales department.</p><hr>
      <p> I made my first steps in programming when I was teenager. I made a simple website using HTML and CSS,
      based on a template, which i found on the Internet. That experience helped me make the decision
      to become a programmer. At the end of 2019 I started learning Python.
      When I learned the basics of Python I started to develop my skills with django framework.
      There is still a lot to do, but I am very eager to learn new things.</p>
      <p>This is my first public shared project</p>
